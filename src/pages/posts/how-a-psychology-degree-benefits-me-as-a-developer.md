Degrees are not valued as highly in today’s job market as they once were.
Previously, securing a stable position was nearly impossible without a degree—
and it generally had to be in a technical field. Times have changed. While
they are still desirable for many employers, they’re often no longer at the
top of the “ideal candidate” requirements list.

As stated in the title, my degree is in a non-technical field. Around 2019, I
began watching online lectures on behavioral psychology and quickly realized it
was the right fit for me. Delving into how the human mind operates and how
memory functions fascinated me so deeply that I decided to apply to SWPS
University in Warsaw for psychology. Fast forward a few years, and I now have a
bachelor’s degree. But how does psychology connect with my main passion:
programming?

## Psychology degrees are rare among developers

Throughout the last five years of my software career, I've not met any
developers with a psychology degree. Most programmers pursue computer science or
cybersecurity, which provide a solid technical foundation. However, these fields
often overlook soft skills—interpersonal abilities crucial in today’s highly
collaborative work environments. Writing effective TypeScript code is only part
of the job. Equally important is clear communication, maintaining team
alignment, and resolving conflicts. In my experience, psychology studies focus
intensively on communication. While you do learn about cognitive paradigms and
the biology of the brain, the primary lesson is how to interact and engage with
others. This is essential across all areas of psychology.

## How it improved my learning process

Soft skills are significant, but my main reason for choosing university was
practical knowledge. A brief digression: I was once asked, by one of my cousins,
which superpower I would pick. Options included flying, speed, or invisibility. 
My first thought was, “To remember anything I want, whenever I need it.” 
My psychology degree brought me a little closer to this dream! 
There are proven methods for learning faster and retaining more information, 
and I use these daily—especially during preparation for certificate exams:

### Mental maps

Take a sheet of paper and colored pencils. Write your target topic in the
center—for example, “React – JavaScript library.” Around it, draw shapes for
subtopics. For instance, React features hooks, and some are built-in. Write
“hooks” and add a pirate illustration beside it. By associating images with
concepts, you help your brain retain them. Next time someone asks about React
hooks, the image of a pirate and details will likely come to mind instantly.
Try it—it works!

### Understanding boredom

Boredom is a critical aspect of life, though many believe it should be avoided.
Scrolling through TikTok or aimlessly browsing the internet fills time but
offers little value. Allow yourself to feel bored sometimes. This state helps
your mind focus on what genuinely matters. With fewer distractions, you’ll find
greater motivation for meaningful activities, like learning new skills. When I
began programming, I would remove distractions and leave only the code editor
open. After about ten minutes, my mind recognized that programming was the best
way to alleviate boredom, leading to long, productive learning sessions. It felt
almost like a superpower.

These examples highlight only a few ways psychology aids learning. While much of
this advice is available online, it’s rarely discovered by chance. As with any
specialty, university offers the fastest way to systematically explore a field.

## Was It Worth It?

All technical knowledge about computers and software can be learned online. I do
exactly that by reading articles, watching videos, and building apps daily.
However, mastering social skills, dealing with stress, and teamwork are much
harder to acquire digitally. These skills were a core part of my university
education and greatly benefit my professional life.

Start by learning how to learn, and everything else becomes much simpler!
