I have been a professional developer for nearly five years now. During that 
time, I have worked on a ton of projects; most of them, of course, remain 
unfinished (as this is often the case in the coding journey). 
From SaaS products, dashboards, and landing pages to TUI apps or even 
simple databases - I tried a lot. 

However, most of my work is stored in private GitHub repositories. 
Since I value coding highly, I don't like showing unfinished work - 
for some reason it makes me uncomfortable. This leads to some issues, such as:

- I can't showcase my work to recruiters or anyone involved in 
the hiring process.
- My credibility suffers as I could look like I just add random stuff to GitHub
to seem productive.
- Other developers can't contribute to my code.

So, I decided it was time for a change.

## Creating portfolio from scratch

The easiest solution to this problem is to _finish_ projects, rather than
just start them. I know it sounds simple, but it's true. I love planning 
things so here is my approach:

- Brainstorm 3-4 projects that demonstrate my expertise across different areas.
- Focus on mainstream technologies so the projects are relatable.
- Include a couple of projects that push me to learn technologies that I didn't 
encountered before.
- Plan work for the next weeks thoroughly, including creating epics, stories, 
and tasks (maybe just tasks, but let's see)
- Document everything on this blog and share on social media to keep myself
accountable

At the end of this "challenge" I should have decent portfolio of finished 
projects that I will proudly be able to showcase. I will probably learn a lot 
along the way, try new languages and test myself in diverse areas of programming.

Follow me along on this new journey!
