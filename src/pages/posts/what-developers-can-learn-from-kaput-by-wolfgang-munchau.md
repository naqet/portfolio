For the last few months, I’ve gotten back into the habit of reading. Throughout
the year, my reading pace fluctuates: sometimes I read a lot, other times, I
barely pick up a book. To smooth out these cycles, I started adding "read 15
pages" to my daily to-do list, which has helped me finish books consistently.

I just finished "Kaput" by Wolfgang Münchau. This book explores Germany’s
economic situation in the 20th and 21st centuries, and I found some surprising
lessons applicable to navigating the ever-changing world of technology as a
developer.

I won’t cover the political side of the book here. Instead, I want to translate
its economic arguments into takeaways for our field.

## Don't rely on only one skill/technology

Münchau describes how Germany’s dependency on one source of cheap energy left
their economy exposed. When that source became unavailable, it triggered serious
problems. For developers, this illustrates why specializing in just one skill or
tech stack is risky.

Tech evolves quickly, so regularly ask: what new technologies might be worth
learning? Is it necessary to jump on every new framework, or focus on those
likely to be lasting? Not every trend matters long-term, but occasionally, major
shifts are worth the investment.

If you're a Frontend Developer, don’t stick only to React—explore alternatives
like Vue or Astro. If time is limited, prioritize learning broadly adopted
technologies rather than niche ones unlikely to impact your career.

Germany’s economy also suffered from focusing too much on heavy industry (like
cars and chemicals), while missing opportunities in emerging tech sectors.
Dominance in one area can be dangerous if you ignore the future or shifting
markets.

Similarly, foundational concepts like memory allocation or data structures are
important, but not enough by themselves. To stand out, keep evolving and
anticipate which skills will matter—and which are on the way out.

## Welcome, support, and recognize new team members

One point Münchau makes is that Germany struggles to retain highly educated
immigrants partly because newcomers feel excluded or undervalued. This is
relevant to workplace culture everywhere—not just nationally.

Every team member brings something valuable. Make newcomers feel welcome,
recognize their contributions, and foster positive culture. Many high-performing
developers leave due to poor team culture or a lack of recognition. While some
mismatches are unavoidable, most environments can be made healthier.

## Is that all?

There’s more to Münchau’s book, but I don't want to spoil it, because I
recommend reading it.

Every book offers wisdom you can apply to your circumstances—translate fresh
ideas into your own life. As my biggest idol, Kobe Bryant, said:

> Once you know what it is in life that you want to do, then the world basically
> becomes your library.
